Earlier today I thought to myself, "if browsers can [prefetch DNS](htt	ps://www.google.co.uk/#q=dns+prefetch), surely JavaScript could prefecth web pages?"

I wasn't wrong.

A quick Google search sent me to http://instantclick.io, which, in the developer's words, offers:

>a JavaScript library that dramatically speeds up your website, making navigation effectively instant in most cases.

It works like this:

1. A user hovers over (or touches, on touchscreens) an internal link on your site.
2. InstantClick loads the page for the link in the background.
3. If the user clicks the link, InstantClick updates your &lt;title&gt; and &lt;body&gt; to display the new content.

That means your page loads as fast as the browser can process the JavaScript, which is damn-near instant in most cases.

Sound good? [Download a copy here](http://instantclick.io).

Using WordPress? [One-click-install plugin here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/instantclick/).

Feeling a bit nerdy? [Get the GitHub repository here](https://github.com/dieulot/instantclick).

I've installed it on our company website and I must say, I am very impressed. Going to try and get a copy running on this blog soon.

Sing your song in the comments, and don't forget to thank author [Alex Dieulot](https://github.com/dieulot/).
