HubSpot have put together a fantastic list of the most shared keywords from early 2015 (split by social network and category).

Bookmark this as a reference for when you're writing your blog posts to help keep them shareable. Don't forget, the title is arguably the most important thing from the perspective of a new user (it's basically your shop window).
