Thinking about getting a Fire Stick from Amazon ([you should](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-W87CUN-Fire-TV-Stick/dp/B00KAKUN3E))? Already got yourself a Fire Stick (good job) and wondering what you can do with it?

Getting live TV on your Fire Stick is pretty damn simple actually. All you have to do is download the **[TV Player](http://www.tvplayer.com/amazon)** app from Amazon's store.

If your Fire Stick is currently logged into your Amazon account, you should even be able to install it directly to your device from Amazon's website:

If not, switch on your Fire Stick:

- Navigate to **Search** at the top of the left-hand menu.
- Search for `tv player` (you can get away with just `tv pl`
